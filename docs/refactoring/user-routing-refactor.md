# User Routing Refactoring Plan

## Current Situation
We have identified legacy code in our authentication flow that is no longer being executed due to earlier redirects. This code contains valuable information about expected routing behavior based on user states.

## Proposed Solution
We propose refactoring this code to improve maintainability and preserve the routing logic for potential future use. The recommended approach combines creating a separate function for routing logic and using a configuration object for route mapping.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a configuration object for user routes:

```javascript
const userRoutes = {
  isAdmin: '/dashboard',
  submitted: '/welcome',
  authenticated: '/onboarding',
  default: '/'
};
```

2. Implement a function to determine the user route:

```javascript
function determineUserRoute(user, status) {
  if (user?.isAdmin) return userRoutes.isAdmin;
  if (user?.submitted) return userRoutes.submitted;
  if (status === 'authenticated') return userRoutes.authenticated;
  return userRoutes.default;
}
```

3. Create a routing function that can be called when needed:

```javascript
function routeUser(user, status) {
  const route = determineUserRoute(user, status);
  console.log(`Routing user to: ${route}`);
  // Actual routing logic here
}
```

## Benefits
- Preserves routing logic for future use
- Improves code organization and testability
- Makes routing rules more declarative and easier to maintain
- Allows for easy expansion of user states and routes

## Next Steps
1. Review the proposed changes with the team
2. Decide on the appropriate location for this new code (e.g., a new utility file)
3. Implement the changes
4. Update any affected components or middleware to use the new routing function
5. Remove the legacy code from its current location
6. Test thoroughly to ensure all routing scenarios work as expected

## Notes
- The actual implementation may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of our Next.js setup and any existing routing mechanisms.
- Consider implementing this as middleware if it needs to run for every request.
