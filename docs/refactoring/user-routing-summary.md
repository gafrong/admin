# User Routing Refactoring Summary

## Objectives
1. Centralize user routing logic
2. Improve maintainability and scalability
3. Ensure consistency in routing behavior

## Key Components
1. New utility file: `src/utils/userRouting.js`
   - Contains `userRoutes` object
   - Implements `determineUserRoute` and `routeUser` functions

2. Updated `protect-route.js`
   - Uses new routing utility

## Benefits
- Centralized routing logic
- More declarative and maintainable routing rules
- Easier expansion of user states and routes
- Improved consistency across the application

## Next Steps
1. Implement changes in `userRouting.js` and `protect-route.js`
2. Update other components using the new `routeUser` function
3. Thorough testing of all routing scenarios
4. Consider implementing role-based access control if needed

## Note
Actual implementation may need adjustments based on specific Next.js setup and existing routing mechanisms.
